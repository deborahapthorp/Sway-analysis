# Postural Sway and Cognition in Dementia

This is a repository for data analysis for an Honours project conducted by my student Ella Trevaskes under my supervision at the University of New England, NSW. 

Data will be collected from elderly participants with and without a dementia diagnosis, including postural sway data collected on a Bertec balance plate, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, and some basic demographic data. 

Analysis code for sway variables and other data will be collated here.
